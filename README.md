# Instrument Tuner
This project is a work in progress as I am learning about the Fourier Transform. However, in this project I utilize Fast Fourier Transform data from the Web Audio API and determine the fundamental frequency by getting the maximum decibel frequency in the frequency bin.
# Execute Project
npm install

npm run dev
